NAD-GNN: A novel temporal graph neural network approach for network attack detection
===============================================================================

About
-----
This project is the implementation of the paper "NAD-GNN: A novel temporal graph neural network approach for network attack detection".

This repo contains the codes, data and results reported in the paper.


Dependencies
-----
The script has been tested running under Python 3.7.7, with the following packages installed (along with their dependencies):

* networkx, scipy, sklearn, numpy, pickle


Some Python module dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`, which can be easily installed with pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

ðŸ”’ Model Availability
The NAD-GNN model source code and detailed implementation are not yet included in this repository.
They will be released after the corresponding paper is accepted.
For now, this repository provides the web interface and API demo to showcase how the model can be integrated into real-world systems.


Usage for : 

```
	python NAD-GNN.py
```
The verision of jupyter notebook is also supported as: NAD-GNN.ipynb
